Description:
	RLMTownNoMobs is a plugin for Bukkit, which prevents hostile mobs from spawning
	naturally within towns while still allowing them to walk in from outside. Neutral
	and friendly mobs are not affected by default, as well as mobs spawned from
	unnatural causes (i.e. spawners, eggs, commands).
